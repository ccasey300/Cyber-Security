"SOC L1 Alert Reporting:"
    * How to properly report, escalate and communicate about high-risk alerts.
    * What happens after classification and triaging?
    * Most alerts are classified as false positives by L1 analysts. L2 handles more threatening ones.
    
    1.  Alert Reporting
        * Documents investigation in detail, not just comments. Important for true positives, include evidence.
        
    2.  Alert Escalation
        * If a true positive requires additional actions or investigation, escalated to L2.
        * L2 uses previously written alert report.

    3.  Communication
        
"Guide on Reporting:"
    * Provide context. Save time for L2 analysts.
    * Save findings for the record. Keep all context inside the alert as these are stored indefinitely. (Logs are not)
    * Improve investigation skills. Boost L1 skillset by simply describing alert.

    ** Recommended to use the 5 W's. Who, what, where, why, when.


"Escalation Guide:"
    * Escalation is done if:
        - Alert indicates major cyberattack
        - Remediation required, e.g malware removal, host isolation, password reset.
        - Communication with customers, law enforcement etc. required.
        - Don't understand it.

    * Often, all that is required is reassigning alert to the L2 analyst, notifying them.
