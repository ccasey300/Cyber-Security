"System Attack Vectors:"
    * [System]      a physical server, a virtual machine, or a cloud platform like Microsoft 365.
    * In most attacks, first goal is to gain access to a system.
    
    "How attacks begin:"
    [Human Led]         Some person downloads malware onto a machine. (RubberDucky, USB containing malware)
    [Vulnerabilities]   Software vulnerabilities are security flaws, weak passwords are another.
    [Supply Chain]      Typically applications rely on thousands of libraries. 
                        Threat actor infects a trusted app, could be devastating for all downstream.
                        E.g SolarWinds

    "Vulnerabilities:"
        * Worst case, nobody is aware of the vuln besides the attacker -> Zero Day
        * When a vulnerability is made public, assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) number.
        * Defenders then rush to update software, attackers try to take advantage of systems w deprecated software.
        * The answer to a CVE is a patch. Try to survive until it is released:
                
            * Restricting access to the system to only trusted IPs
            * Applying temporary measures provided by the vendor
            * Blocking known attack patterns on IPS or WAF

    "Misconfigurations:"
        * Mistake in how the system was set up, likely by IT.
        * Convenience is the enemy of security. -> Weak passwords
        * How to respond to potential misconfig?
            
            - Penetration Testing: Hire ethical "hackers" who simulate an attack and report on discovered security flaws
            - Vulnerability Scans: Periodically run tools that can detect default passwords or outdated software
            - Configuration Audits: Manually review the systems to match best practices like CIS benchmarks
