"Security Analyst Intro:"
    * Going to have to become a [Triage specialist.]
    * [Triage]:  assessing, categorizing, and prioritizing security alerts, bugs, or incidents
    
    * What does a security analyst do:
        - Monitor and investigate alerts (24x7 SOC operations environment)
        - Configure and manage security tools.
        - Develope and implement IDS (Intrusion Detection System) signatures.
        - Create tickets and escalate the security incidents 

    * Security Operations Center (SOC) follows a 3 tier model, alerts are escalated

    [CompTIA Security+]     Desirable in this space!


    "Security Operations Center:"
        * Investigate, monitor, prevent and monitor threats around the clock.

        [Preparation & Prevention]
            * Gathering intelligence on latest threats, actors and their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures)
            * Updating firewall signatures, patching vulnerabilities in existing systems.
            * Block listing and safe listing applications, IPs, email addresses.

        [Monitoring & Investigation]
            To monitor suspicious/maliciious network activity:
                * An SOC team proactively uses SIEM (Security Information and Event Management).
                * Also EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response).
            * Security analysts prioritise alerts based on: low, med, high.

            * Understanding how, when why:
                 -> Drilling down on the data logs and alerts & using open source tools.

        [Response]
            * Taking action on compromised hosts, isolating these, terminating malicious processes, deleting files, etc.
