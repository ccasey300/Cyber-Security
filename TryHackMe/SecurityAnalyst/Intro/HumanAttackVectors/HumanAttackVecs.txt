"Human Attack Vectors:"
    * Easier to target an IT admin than a firewall itself.
    * Humans can provide a lot of access when compromised.
    
    "Attacks on Humans:"
        * Commonality: manipulate the victim into helping the attacker.
            => Social Engineering.

        * Attacks are designed to be:
            [Trustworthy]: The attacker must appear legitimate so the victim trusts them
            [Emotional]: The attack must trigger feelings like urgency, fear, or curiosity

        * Most common, phishing. When you send a malicious e.g email, redirects to a phony site, steal login credentials.

        [Malware]   Convince victim to download some file, get victim to execute, steal data/ install spyware etc.
        [DeepFake]  Impersonating a victim's colleagues, family, authority figure in order to manipulate.

        "Mitigations against Social Engineering:"
            Anti-phishing solution 	        SOC routine becomes easier with a tool that blocks phishing emails before the users even notice
            Antivirus / EDR solution 	    A reliable antivirus on all corporate hosts is a great measure to prevent humans from running malware
            "Trust but verify" principle 	Instruct your employees how to detect deepfakes and verify suspicious requests from "CEO" or "IT"
            Security awareness training 	Teach your employees how to detect phishing and reinforce training through phishing simulations
