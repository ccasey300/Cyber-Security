"Extending Networks:"
    * Learning about technologies used to extend networks out onto the internet.

    "Port Forwarding:"
        * Essential component in connecting applications or services to the internet.
        * Without it, things like web servers would only be available on the network.
        * Port forwarding opens specific ports.
        * Firewalls determine if traffic can travel across these ports, even if ports are open by port forwarding.
        * Routers configure port forwarding!

    "Firewalls:"
        * Network device reponsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit.
        * Bases decision on a number of factors, such as:
            Where the traffic is coming from?       (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic from a specific network?)
            Where is the traffic going to?          (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for a specific network?)
            What port is the traffic for?           (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for port 80 only?)
            What protocol is the traffic using?     (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic that is UDP, TCP or both?)

        * Firewalls perform packet inspection to determine these answers.
        * Firewalls can be hardware or software. Example of software is Snort "https://www.snort.org/"
        * There are two broad categories. Stateful and stateless.

        Stateful	

            [This type of firewall uses the entire information from a connection; rather than inspecting an individual packet, this firewall determines the behaviour of a device based upon the entire connection.]

            [This firewall type consumes many resources in comparison to stateless firewalls as the decision making is dynamic. For example, a firewall could allow the first parts of a TCP handshake that would later fail.]

            [If a connection from a host is bad, it will block the entire device.]


        Stateless	

            [This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not individual packets are acceptable or not. For example, a device sending a bad packet will not necessarily mean that the entire device is then blocked.]
            
            [Whilst these firewalls use much fewer resources than alternatives, they are much dumber. For example, these firewalls are only effective as the rules that are defined within them. If a rule is not exactly matched, it is effectively useless.]

            [However, these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack)]

        "Firewalls operate at the Network (3) & Transport (4) layers of the OSI model."


    "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) Basics:"
        * Allow two hosts to communicate via a dedicated, encrypted tunnel. 
        * Devices connected this way form their own network!

        "Benefits of VPNs:"
        [
            * Connects networks in different geographical locations

            * Privacy and anonymity with encryption.
                -> However, only as anonymous as the level of privacy granted by other devices on the network!
                -> A VPN that logs history/ data is useless in this regard.
        ]

        "VPN Technologies:"
            1.  PPP
                [
                    Used by PPTP (below) to allow encryption and authentication. 
                    Similar to SSH, a private key and public certificate must match to connect.
                    This technology is not capable of leaving the network by itself, non routable.
                ]

            2.  PPTP
                [
                    Point to Point Tunnelling Protocol.
                    Allows data from PPP to travel and leave the network.
                    Very easy to set up, supported by most devices.
                    Weak encryption compared to other alternatives!
                ]

            3.  IPSec
                [
                    Internet Protocol Security encrypts data using existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework.
                    Boasts strong encryption, supported by most devices.
                    However, difficult to set up.
                ]

            
    "LAN Networking Devices:"
        [Routers]
            * Connects networks and passes data between them using routing.
            * Involves creating a path between networks so that data is successfully delivered.
            * Network layer (3) devices. Often feature an interactive website/ console, allowing admin to configure rules.
            * Routing is useful when there are many possible paths. We want the optimal path to be taken.

        [Switches]
            * Dedicated networking device that provides a means of connection to multiple hosts.
            * Facilitate 3-63 devices using ethernet.
            * Switches can operate at Data Link layer (2) and Network layer (3). 
            * However, layer 2 switch cannot operate at layer 3, and vice-versa.
            
            * Layer 2 switches are solely responsible for sending frames to the correct host.
            * Layer 3 switches send frames to devices AND route packets to other hosts using IP.

        [VLAN]
            * Virtual Local Area Network. Allows sets of hosts to be virtually split up.
            * Allows for treating hosts differently depending on VLAN.
            * Separation provides security. Rules in place determine how specific hosts can communicate with one another.
