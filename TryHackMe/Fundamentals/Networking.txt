"What is Networking?"
    * Definition: 
        "A system of two or more connected devices (computers, servers, peripherals, etc.), 
        that communicate and share resources, data, information."
    * The internet is a 'Network of networks.' Remember Postal systems for sending letters and parcels.

"What is the Internet?"
    * The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. Funded by the US Defense Dep.
    * Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989.
    * The small (e.g local) networks are called private networks.
    * The larger infrastructure that connects them are public networks.

"Identifying Hosts on a Network"
    * To connect and maintain order, devices must be: 1. Identifying and 2. Identifiable.
    * We use two identifiers for a host:
        1. IP (Internet Protocol) address, changes.
        2. MAC (Media Access Control) Address, hardware assigned identifier. (Fingerprint, somewhat permanent).

    "IP ADDRESSES:"
        * Used as a way to identify a host on a network for a period of time. 
        * Four octets, longest prefix matching. 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255
        * IP addresses follow a set of protocols, backbone of networking, forces communication in a 'certain language.'
        
        Example: 2 devices on a private network. Both have a private IP address, share the same public IP.

    "IP ADDRESS VERSIONS"
        * Previously discussed IPv4 addressing scheme. It grants 2^32 IP addresses (4.29 billion).
        * IPv6 on the other hand, supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion-plus).
        * More efficient due to modern methodologies.

    "MAC ADDRESSES:"
        * Devices on a network have a physical network interface. Microchip found on the motherboard.
        * MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number. Pairs are separated by colons.
        * INTERESTINGLY MAC addresses can be spoofed (faked).
        * When a network device pretends to be another.

    "PING, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)"
        * Ping uses ICMP packets to infer performance of a connection.
        * Time taken is determined using ICMP echo and awaiting ICMP echo reply from target.
