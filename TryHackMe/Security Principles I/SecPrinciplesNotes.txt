    Assessing if secure: (CIA)
Confidentiality: Only intended person(s) can access data.
Integrity: Ensure data can't be altered. If altered, should be detected.
Availability: System or service available when needed.

* Further, consider authenticity (ensure claimed source) and nonrepudiation (original source cannot deny ownership of data/doc/file)

    How attacks happen:
Disclosure: Attack on confidentiality
Alteration: Opposite of integrity.
Destruction/Denial: Attack on availability.


Using security models, we can provide necessary guarantees. 

    Bell-LaPadula Model
Achieves confidentiality using three rules:
* Simple Security Property: Subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. Known as "No read up."
* Star Security Property: Subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security. Known as "No write down." 
* Discretionary-Security Property: Uses an access matrix to allow read/write operations.
* Works well in military due to vetting.

    The Biba Integrity Model
"No write up, no read down"
* Subjects may write to objects at or below their level.
* Subjects may read objects above their level.
* Biba is good when integrity is more important than confidentiality.



    The Clark-Wilson Model


Threat Modelling
    The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:

    * Preparation
    * Identification
    * Mitigations
    * Review

Frameworks that help model threats:
STRIDE (Spoofing identity, Tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges) 
PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

Incident Response Phases:
Preparation	
    Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?
Identification	
    Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
Containment	
    Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
Eradication	
    Remove the active threat.
Recovery 	
    Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.
Lessons Learned	
    What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails.
