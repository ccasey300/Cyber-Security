"Windows Fundamentals:"

    "New Technology File System (NTFS):"
        * New Technology File System (NTFS) is used in modern windows.
        * Previously used FAT16, FAT32, HPFS.
        * Still see FAT (File Allocation Table) used in USB devices.
        * NTFS is a journaling file system, can automatically repair folders/files based on a log.
        Pros:
            - Encrypted.
            - Supports files larger than 4Gb. 
            - Allows for file/folder compression.
            - Set specific permissions for files/ folders.

        * On NTFS volumes, you can set the following permissions:
            
            [Full control]
            [Modify]
            [Read & Execute]
            [List folder contents]
            [Read]
            [Write]

        * To check permissions:
            1. Go to properties.
            2. Click securities tab.
            3. Within Group or user names, select.

        "NTFS also allows for Alternative Data Streams (ADS):"
            * Every file has at least one Data Stream.
            * Powershell can be used to view ADS for files.
            * Has been used to hide malware!

    "Windows/ System32 Folders:"
        * [C:\Windows]                          [%windir%]          Contains operating system. Here's its env variable.
        * [C:\Windows\System32]                                     Important files critical to OS. BE CAREFUL! Read more:

    "Accounts, profiles and permissions:"
        * Administrators can make changes to the system. (add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc.)
        * Regular user can only make changesto folders/files attributed to them. Cannot perform system level changes, such as installing programs.
        
        * To determine other users on the machine, simply look up other users from start menu. Add users will show more detail.

    

    "User Account Control:"
        * UAC combats malware. In case of local admin, current session is not ran as admin! 
        * Instead, ran as lower privilege user. If action requires admin, they are prompted.
