"Windows Active Directory:"
    * Simplifies the management of devices and users in a corporate environment.
    * To overcome problems with creating, configuring & maintaining users in large corporations:
        "We use a Windows Domain"
    
        * [Windows Domain]      Group of users under administration for a given business.
    Centralises the common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository "Active Directory."

    ** The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as the "Domain Controller (DC)"
    * Main advantages of having a configured Windows Domain:
        1.  Centralised ID management:      All users in network can be configured from AD with minimal effort.
        2.  Managing security policies:     Configure security policies from AD, apply to users and PCs across the network.

    "Active Directory Domain Service:"
        * Core of any windows domain.
        * Acts as a catalogue for all objects on the network.
        E.g  users, groups, machines, printers, shares

        "Users:"
            * V common, known as security principals due to ability to be authenticated by domain.
            * Therefore can be assigned privs to act upon resources in the network.
            
            ** Users are either "Services" or "people."
            * E.g  persons in the organisation 

        "Machines:"
            * Another type of obj within AD. 
            * For every computer that joins the Active Directory Domain, new machine object created.
            * Also considered security principles. They are local admins on the assigned computer.

            * Generally, not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer itself.
            * However, with user and password can be logged in.

            => Machine Account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random characters.

            * Identify the machine by naming scheme. "Computer_Name" + "$"
                => E.g  DC01 -->  DC01$

        "User Groups:"
            * Assign access rights to files or other resources to groups of users.
            * Adding a user results in inheriting these privileges.

                Security Group 	Description
                Domain Admins 	Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs.
                Server Operators 	Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.
                Backup Operators 	Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.
                Account Operators 	Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.
                Domain Users 	Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.
                Domain Computers 	Includes all existing computers in the domain.
                Domain Controllers 	Includes all existing DCs on the domain.

        "Accessing Active Directory Users and Computers"
            * To configure users, groups or machines in AD need to login to Domain Controller.
            * Search [Active Directory Users and Computers]
            
            * Organizational Units (OUs) are containers used to classify users/machines.
                Define users with similar policing requirements.
                User can only be in one OU.

            Worksflow:
                [Search "Active Directory Users and Computers"]
                -> Opens a hierarchy of users, computers etc. objs in the domain.

            * Default Windows containers:
            
                Builtin: Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
                Computers: Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
                Domain Controllers: Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
                Users: Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
                Managed Service Accounts: Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.

            * [OUs] good for applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations
            * [Security Groups] are used to grant permissions over resources. 
 
            
        "Managing Users in Active Directory:"
            * By default, OUs are protected from accidental deletion. 
                ->View->Advanced Features

            * Then, we can disable this protection and view additional containers.

                "Delegation"
                    * Giving certain users control over particular OUs.
                    * Allows said users to perform advanced features without Domain Admin!
                    E.g granting IT support the privileges to reset other low-privilege users' passwords.

                    - Avoid typos by searching with 'find users'

                "Managing Computers in AD"
                    * By default, every device that connects (excl DCs) put in container [Computers]
                    * Segregation tends to be based  on functionality:

                        1.  Workstations
                            => Devices used to perform every day browsing/tasks. 
                            ** Should never have privileged user logged into them!

                        2.  Servers
                            => Used to provide services to users and other servers.

                        3.  Domain Controllers
                            => Allow management of Active Domain.
                            ** These devices are sensitive. Contain hashed passwords for all user accounts!
