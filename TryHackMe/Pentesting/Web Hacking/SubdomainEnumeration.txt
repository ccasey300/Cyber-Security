Subdomain Enumeration:
    {
    "Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying valid subdomains in order to expand the attack surface..."

    We look at three methods: brute force, OSINT & virtual host.
    OSINT:
        [
            SSL/TLS Certificates: (Secure Socket Layer, Transport layer security)
                * When a TLS certificate is created for a domain by a CA (certified authority), CA takes part in Certificate Transparency logs.
                * These are publicly available records of every SSL/TLS certificate created for the domain.
                * This helps to stop malicious/accidental certs from being used.
                * This can be leveraged to discover subdomains!
                * Sites like https://crt.sh/

            Search Engines: 
                * site:*.domain.com -site:www.domain.com is used to find SUBDOMAINS, excludes links to www.domain.com
        ]


    Bruteforce:
        [
            * Bruteforce DNS enumeration is the method of trying a list of possible subdomains from a commonly used selection.
            * This is automated with tools like: DNSrecon

        ]
    
    OSINT: Sublist3r
        [
            * To speed up subdomain discovery we can use automated tools like sublist3r.
        ]

    Virtual Hosts:
    [
        * Some subdomains are not hosted in publicly available DNS results. (Development versions, admin portals)
        * They can be hosted on private DNS servers or recorded on the developers machine.
        * For example in /etc/hosts file (or c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
        * Web servers can host multiple websites, hence when a client requests a website, it is specified in the host header.
        * We can leverage the host header by making changes to it and monitoring the response.
        * Like with DNS bruteforce, this is automated using a wordlist of commonly used subdomains.
        * Using ffuf: 
            - ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://MACHINE_IP
                Uses the -w switch to specify the wordlist. -h edits the header. FUZZ keyword is where subdomain would usually be.
                Always returns a result, but we can filter the output:
            =>
