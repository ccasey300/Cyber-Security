        "RECEIVE CREDENTIALS FROM SOFTWARE... PUTTY!"
            * PuTTY is an SSH client found on Windows.
            * Instead of specifying connection parameters every time, PuTTY stores session configuration info.
            * These configs include proxy configurations, storing cleartext authentication credentials.

            * To retrieve proxy credentials:
                [reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\ /f "Proxy" /s]

            ** PuTTY stores credentials, other software could store passwords, (browser, email clients, FTP clients, SSH clients, etc.).
