        Excessive privileges assigned to our account
        Vulnerable software
        Missing Windows security patches

    "Windows Users"
        Administrators	        These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access 
                                any file in the system.
        Standard Users	        These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users 
                                can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files.

        SYSTEM / LocalSystem    An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access 
                                to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.

        Local Service           Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. 
                                It will use anonymous connections over the network.

        Network Service         Default account used to run Windows services with "minimum" privileges. 
                                It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.
