    VULNERABILITIES:                Description:

    Operating System                Found within Operating Systems (OSs), often result in privilege escalation.
    (Mis)Configuration-based        Stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. Example a website exposing customer details.
    Weak or Default Credentials     Element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
    Application Logic               Result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
    Human-Factor                    Vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.


    VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT:
        * Process of evaluating, categorising and ultimately remediating threats.
        * Only approx 2% of vulnerabilities are exploited!
        * VULN Management is about identifying the most dangerous vulnerabilities and reduce likelihood of it being used to exploit. 
        * There are different ways to score these risks.

        Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
            * Current version is 3. Based on three factors: 
                1.  How easy is it to exploit?
                2.  Do exploits exist for this?
                3.  How does it affect CIA? (Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility)
            * We use this calculator: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator

                None	    0
                Low	        0.1 - 3.9
                Medium	    4.0 - 6.9
                High	    7.0 - 8.9
                Critical	9.0 - 10.0
            
        VULNERABILITY PRIORITY RATING:
            * Much more modern framework than CVSS. Risk driven!
            * Heavy focus on the risk a vuln posed to the organisation.
            * Dynamic in its scoring. Risk posed by vulns changes on a daily basis.

                Low	        0.0 - 3.9
                Medium	    4.0 - 6.9
                High	    7.0 - 8.9
                Critical	9.0 - 10.0

    
    VULNERABILITY DATABASES:
        * The following track vulnerabilities on a variety of systems/ softwares/ etc.
        1.  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln
        2.  http://exploit-db.com/

        * First, some definitions:
            Vulnerability	                A weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application.
            Exploit	                        An action or behaviour that utilises a vulnerability on a system or application.
            Proof of Concept (PoC)	        Technique or tool that often demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability.

        National Vulnerability Database:
            * Lists all publicly categorised vulnerabilities. 
            * Classified under COMMON VULNERABILITIES AND EXPOSURES, (CVE). CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER
            * Not very useful when researching particular software's vulnerabilities.
        
        EXPLOIT-DB:
            * MUCH MORE HELPFUL DURING AN ASSIGNMENT. 
            * Exploits stored under the name, author and version of the software or application.
            * Example use Exploit-DB to look for proof of concept exploits for certain vulnerabilities.
