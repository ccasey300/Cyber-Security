SQL Injection:
    * SQL - Structured Query Language. Used on databases attached to web servers.
    * When user input is not validated, could result in theft/deletion/alteration of database.
    * Can also lead to attacks against authentication methods to private or customer areas.

Databases: (Overview)
    * A database is a way of storing information in an organised manner.
    * Controlled by a DBMS (DB management system), that can be relational or non-relational.
    * Can be multiple databases within a DBMS. E.g shop vs staff vs accounts may share/exclude info.
    * Table: Each row contains an e.g users info. Each collumn stores information relating to e.g users.
    * Column: Known as a field. Has a unique name per table, data type specified.
    * Row: Known as a record, when we add to the database a new row is created.

MySQL Statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. SQL syntax not case-sensitive.

    SELECT - retrieve data:
    select * from users;          # all columns
    select username,password from users; # specific columns
    select * from users LIMIT 1;  # limit rows, LIMIT skip,count
    select * from users where username='admin'; # filter rows
    select * from users where username != 'admin';
    select * from users where username='admin' or username='jon';
    select * from users where username='admin' and password='p4ssword';
    select * from users where username like 'a%';  # starts with 'a'
    select * from users where username like '%n';  # ends with 'n'
    select * from users where username like '%mi%'; # contains 'mi'

    UNION - combine results of 2+ SELECTs; must match column count, type, order:
    SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers 
    UNION 
    SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;

    INSERT - add new row:
    insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');

    UPDATE - modify existing rows:
    update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';

    DELETE - remove rows:
    delete from users where username='martin'; # delete specific
    delete from users;                          # delete all

What is SQL Injection?:
    * Occurs when user input is used in an SQL query.
    Example:    https://website.thm/blog?id=1   --queried-->    SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;
        - if id=2 was blocked         https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--        -- denotes anyting after is comment
