BurpSuite:
    * Integrated platform for testing web app sec, various tools for scanning, fuzzing, intercepting, and analysing web traffic.
    * Core - Burp Proxy.
        A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. 
    * Java based framework, comprehensive suite for pen testing web apps.
    * Industry standard for tesing web & mobile apps, including those reliant on APIs.
    ** Burp Suite captures and enables manipulation of all the HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a browser and a web server.
    * By intercepting requests, we can route them to various BS components.
    * Has ability to intercept, view, and modify web requests before they reach the target server 
    * Can even intercept before the requests reach our browser!

    - Burp Suite Community Edition has:
        Proxy: The Burp Proxy is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
        Repeater: Another well-known feature. Repeater allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
        Intruder: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, Intruder allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
        Decoder: Decoder offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
        Comparer: As the name suggests, Comparer enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
        Sequencer: Sequencer is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.

    Using Burp Suite:
        * There are four quadrants on screen (C-CL from TL):
            - Tasks: The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that Burp Suite will perform while you use the application. In Burp Suite Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. Burp Suite Professional offers additional features like on-demand scans.
            - Event log: The Event log provides information about the actions performed by Burp Suite, such as starting the proxy, as well as details about connections made through Burp.
            - Issue Activity: This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.
            - Advisory: The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediations. This information can be exported into a report. In Burp Suite Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.

    * Global settings apply to all users, projects settings to the specific project.

    Burp Proxy: (Key points)
    - Requests are intercepted and held back from reaching target server.
    - To intercept, click intercept on.
    ** The captured requests can be viewed in the HTTP history and WebSockets history sub-tabs.
    * As standard, proxy does not intercept server response. 
        * Use "intercept based on the following rules"
    * Within proxy settings, match and replace useful.
        * Enables use of regular expressions (regex) to modify in/ out requests. 
        => Allows for dynamic changes such as modifying user agent or cookies manipulation.
    
    * To route Firefox traffic through burp suite, use foxyproxy. 
    * Go to options to create new proxy. 127.0.0.1 port 8080.
    * Click intercept on BS, burpsuite selected on foxyproxy to start. Right click on intercepted requests.

    Site Map & Issue Definitions:
        * Within the target tab there are three sub tabs:

        Site Map:
            This sub-tab allows us to map out the web applications we are targeting in a tree structure.

        Issue Defintions:
            Issue definitions section provides an extensive list of web vulnerabilities

        Scope Settings:
            Allows us to define scope, exclude/include different domains/IPs, avoid capturing unnecessary traffic.

    Scoping and Targeting:
        * By setting a scope, we define what gets provided and logged.
        * Easy way: go to target, right click the web app, add to scope.
        * However, even if not logging the out of scope traffic, it is still intercepted.
        * Go to proxy settings -> intercept client requests -> And URL Is in target scope
        * Results in any traffic out of scope being ignored.

    Proxying HTTPS (TLS)
    * May get error software is preventing from accessing this site safely.
    * Need to import CA cert from Portswigger! Do this in firefox settings.

    XSS example:
    * Take ticket example. Do a test, intercept with Burp Suite.
    * Check out Proxy, inpect the request. Can edit params, e.g email:
        test@test.com   --->   <script>alert("Succ3ssful+XSS")</script>
    * ctr + U encodes the selected email. Then forward.
