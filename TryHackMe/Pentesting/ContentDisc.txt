Content Discovery Notes:
    "Learn the various ways of discovering hidden or private content on a webserver that could lead to new vulnerabilities"

Content: Files, data, website feature, etc.
Content Disc: Refers to finding content that is not intended to be publicly available
    3 types - Manually, Automated & Open Source Int(OSINT)

REP - Robots Exclusion Protocol
    * Dictates what web crawlers are not allowed to crawl.
    * robots.txt lives in root of the website
    * Restricts certain areas of the website from appearing in SE res

Favicon - small icon or branding in the top left corner for a website
    When a framework is used to build a website, sometimes the fav isnt updated
    => Gives insight into framework stack used, can research

    curl https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/favicon/images/favicon.ico | md5sum
    =>gives the md5 hash, compare and find from https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database.

    **if hash ends in 427e, the curl has failed.

Sitemap.xml
    * Unlike robots, defines what CAN be seen on SE results.

HTTP Headers:
    * When we make requests to the web server, various HTTP headers are returned.
    * Can contain useful info regarding the webserver software or programming/scripting language used.
    curl https://asdasdasd -v

Framework Stack:
    * Lets say we found the framework used by favicon or otherwise.
    * Check source code, scroll down, load time and framework version shown.
    * Can read documentation, research vulneralisation

OSINT - Google Hacking & Dorking
    * By using googles advanced search features, can filter results effectively.
    * For example: site:tryhackme.com admin
    * This will look for pages containing admin.
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking

    Examples:
    * site
	    site:tryhackme.com
	    returns results only from the specified website address
    * inurl
	    inurl:admin
	    returns results that have the specified word in the URL
    * filetype
	    filetype:pdf
	    returns results which are a particular file extension
    * intitle
	    intitle:admin
	    returns results that contain the specified word in the title


OSINT - Wappalyzer
    https://www.wappalyzer.com/
    * Online tool that identifies software in use by website.

OSINT - Wayback Machine
    https://archive.org/web/
    * Online archive dating back to the 90s.
    * Helps uncover old pages that may still be active.

OSINT - GitHub
    https://github.com
    * Searching for companies/websites can return informative source code.
    * Perhaps old commits shed light.

OSINT - S3 Buckets
    http://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com/
    * S3 Buckets is a storage service provided by AWS.
    * Access permissions may be incorrect, potential to write!
    * Can discover the address of buckets from source, github, etc.
    * Typically of the form:
        - [name]-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/
        - [name]-public.s3.amazonaws.com/
        - [name]-private.s3.amazonaws.com/

OSINT - Automated Discovery 
    * Process of using tools to discover content.
    * Wordlists make this possible. Long txt files with e.g common passwords.
    * https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
    * Automation tools:
        - ffuf 
            [ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.189.161/FUZZ]
        - dirb
            [dirb http://10.10.189.161/ /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt]
        - gobuster
            [gobuster dir --url http://10.10.189.161/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt]
