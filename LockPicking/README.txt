I began picking locks in early 2024. The documentation is less bulky and the products are less secure.
I am an avid member of LPU (Lock Pickers United).
LPU is a dedicated Reddit/Discord community that, at it's core, is responsible for ranking locks based on their difficulty to pick.
LPU also incorporates a belt system (like karate), allowing lock pickers to measure progress.
To get a belt, one must submit video evidence of appropriate locks being picked and disassembled (to prove they have not been tampered with).

As part of my ongoing submission for black belt, I have:
* Picked and gutted the Dom Twinstar iX. https://youtu.be/-JgcAvlwarM?si=oOrW272nuniiubiU
* Picked, (not on cam yet), the Goal V18 https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/1kuz1b8/my_first_black_belt_lock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

* Helped others get difficult opens (MultiLock Classic, M & C Condor)
* Made custom modifications to create a 'challenge lock.' https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/1hq0fc4/first_challenge_lock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

* Got involved in leathercraft and casemaking. 
* Made 2x custom cutaways (American 1100 padlock, Abloy Classic DD)
(A cutaway is a lock modification intended to expose the locking mechanism.)

-> Nowadays, I spend my time researching Japanese and Scandinavian locks (best in class).
