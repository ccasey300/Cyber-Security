Dancing Lab: (Server Message Block Protocol)
    TARGET IP: 10.129.11.59
    * Server Message Block protocol (SMB) allows transfer of files, usually on port 445 TCP
    * Operates at application layer, hence needs lower level protocols for transport. 
    * Typically NetBios over TCP/IP [NBT] for windows.
    * An SMB-enabled storage is called a share.

    * Clearly this requires authentication (edit, modify, see docs). Hence username and password.
    * Misconfiguration can allow access without any credentials, or by guest accounts or anonymous log-ons
    
    Used:
    ping IP
    nmap IP
    
    (Linux)smbclient \\\\IP\\Share_name     Press enter to check if poorly configured.

Verbose debug command: (Windows)

    nmap -v -d -d -Pn IPADDR
