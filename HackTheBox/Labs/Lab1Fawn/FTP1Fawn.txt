File Transfer Protocol Lab 1: (Fawn)

    From wikipedia, FTP:
        The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used to transfer
        computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a clientâ€“
        server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client
        and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol,
        generally in the form of a username and password. However, they can connect anonymously if
        the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username
        and password and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or
        replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
    
    * Typically port 21.
    * FTP is plaintext, SFTP is encrypted (exntension of SSH).

    Steps:
    * Used ping 10.129.51.251 to make sure target is reachable.
    * Tried     telnet 10.129.51.251    didn't work. 
    * Tried     nmap -Pn 10.129.51.251  
    * Used      nmap -vS 10.129.51.251  to get version of FTP.
        Actually    ncat 10.129.51.251      Gave version... not sure why nmap didn't work.

    * To access the FTP service, need to run ftp command on our own host.
    * Use:  ftp 10.129.51.251
    * Username:     anonymous
    * Password: whatever! server disregards if configured to accept anonymous.
    
    * Next we used      ls              found flag.txt
    * Get the file      get flag.txt    Transferred to local machine
